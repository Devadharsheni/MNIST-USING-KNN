# MNIST-USING-KNN

MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Project Goal:

The objective is to build a KNN model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits (0-9) present in the MNIST dataset.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

KNN is a non-parametric, supervised machine learning algorithm for classification. It classifies data points based on the similarity to their nearest neighbors in the training data.


Data Acquisition: Download the MNIST dataset containing labeled images of handwritten digits.
